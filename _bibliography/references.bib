	abstract = {A hybrid control strategy is introduced that renders a compact set uniformly globally asymptotically stable for a continuous-time plant by switching between a Lyapunov certified feedback controller and an uncertified controller. This control strategy allows for the opportunistic use of a controller that has desirable performance but lacks a Lyapunov certificate. A pair of tunable threshold functions determine conditions for switching between the controllers. To establish global uniform asymptotic stability, a nonsmooth Lyapunov function is constructed for the closed-loop hybrid system using an auxiliary memory variable and the Lyapunov certificate associated with the certified controller. Examples illustrate improvements to control effort and rate of convergence resulting from the proposed hybrid control strategy when applied to state-feedback and model-predictive control.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.2012.6426178},
	abstract = {This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the compositional verification of a continuous system with additively separable barrier functions. The compositional safety verification enables the verification of an interconnection of subsystems. The idea behind the compositional analysis is to allow the verification of systems with a high dimension, by the verification of multiple lower dimensional subproblems. In the compositional safety analysis, a particular structure is imposed on the barrier certificate, restricting the applicability of the method. We show an example of a system that cannot be verified using the compositional method, but can be verified using a centralized method. This example highlights how not to decompose systems, and should be used to guide the decomposition of a system into appropriate subsystems. Finally, we provide a second condition for the compositional safety analysis that enables the verification of the counterexample, by imposing a less restrictive structure of the barrier function. This shows that the counterexample can be solved with a compositional method, but at an increased computational complexity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for safety verification of hybrid systems. For proving that all trajectories of a hybrid system do not enter an unsafe region, the proposed method uses a function of state termed a barrier certificate. The zero level set of a barrier certificate separates the unsafe region from all possible trajectories starting from a given set of initial conditions, hence providing an exact proof of system safety. No explicit computation of reachable sets is required in the construction of barrier certificates, which makes nonlinearity, uncertainty, and constraints can be handled directly within this framework. The method is also computationally tractable, since barrier certificates can be constructed using the sum of squares decomposition and semidefinite programming. Some examples are provided to illustrate the use of the method.},

	abstract = {The control barrier function (CBF) provides a good tool to design supervisory controllers for safety-critical systems. However, constructing a CBF for a general nonlinear system is a challenging task. This paper presents a general CBF computational synthesis approach for nonlinear affine systems with state constraints and input constraints using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. System dynamics and state constraints are approximated using polynomial functions, and the input constraints are approximated using linear functions. The CBF synthesis algorithm is presented step-by-step, and tricks to deal with potential numerical issues during the SOS optimizations are discussed. The proposed algorithm is applied to an automotive lane keeping application to synthesize a CBF, and a supervisory control based on this CBF is designed. The effectiveness and resilience of this CBF-based supervisory control against disturbance are illustrated in simulation with a 14-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model. Results show that this CBF-based supervisory control can improve the resilience of nominal controllers in automotive lane keeping applications.},

An iterative search algorithm is developed to search for the maximum volume barrier certified region of safe stabilization. The barrier certified region, which is allowed to take any arbitrary shape, is proved to be strictly larger than safe regions generated with Lyapunov sublevel set based methods. The proposed approach effectively unites a Lyapunov function with multiple barrier functions that might not be compatible with each other. Simulation results of the iterative search algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. On the model system, this recovered almost identical funnels but was much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. We examine both time-varying rescalings of quadratic forms computed from linearizations and searching directly over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the model system the latter provided larger funnels at the cost of increased computation time.},
