abstract: >
    For a constrained nonlinear control system, an automated supervisor is proposed that determines switching between a barrier functionâ€“certified controller and an uncertified controller. The switching strategy allows for properties of the uncertified controller to be exploited while preserving the forward invariance that is guaranteed by the barrier function for the certified controller. Tunable threshold functions determine regions of the state space where the supervisor switches between controllers. Conditions are given to prevent chattering by establishing a positive minimum time between switches. An example illustrates achieving forward invariance despite using an uncertified MPC controller with delayed computations.
