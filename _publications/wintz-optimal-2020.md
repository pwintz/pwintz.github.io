title: > 
    Optimal Control of A Noncircular Wheel
authors: Paul Wintz

abstract: >
    A model is developed of a non-circular wheel rolling on a road and colliding with
    a short wall. It is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system with a combination of
    continuous- and discrete-time dynamics. Input-output feedback linearization is
    used to design a controller to stabilize the wheel via the application of torque such
    that the wheel is balanced on the wall. A proof of asymptotic stability is provided
    for the feedback linearized control. To compute an optimal control signal, the problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization problem and
    solved with a numerical solver. An elliptical wheel is presented as an example and
    comparisons between various implementations are provided.
