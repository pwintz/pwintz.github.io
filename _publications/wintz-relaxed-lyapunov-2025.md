abstract: >
    Relaxations are provided on Lyapunov functions for uniform global stability properties of compact sets in continuous-time, discrete-time, and hybrid systems. For the hybrid case, simplified conditions on hybrid time domains are given for systems where Lyapunov functions are only strictly decreasing during either flows or jumps. 
    Several auxiliary results are proven for finding continuous positive-definite lower-bounds for positive definite lower semi-continuous functions.
