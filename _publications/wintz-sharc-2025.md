abstract: 
  Tight coupling between computation, communication, and control pervades the design and application of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Due to the complexity of these systems, advanced design procedures that account for these tight interconnections are paramount to ensure the safe and reliable operation of control algorithms under computational constraints. In this paper, we present a tool, called Simulator for Hardware Architecture and Real-time Control (SHARC), to assist in the co-design of control algorithms and the computational hardware on which they are run. SHARC simulates a user-specified control algorithm on a user-specified microarchitecture, evaluating how computational constraints affect the performance of the control algorithm and the safety of the physical system. We illustrate the power of SHARC by examining an adaptive cruise control example and a cart-pole example.
