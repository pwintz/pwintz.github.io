    We develop a second-order time-delayed and spatially offset follow-the-leader model. The velocity of the lead vehicle is reduced as a function of position to simulate passage through a bottleneck in the road. We discuss conditions in our model that produces both forward and back-propagating waves. To quantify our results, we examine the average velocities of each vehicle and determine whether any collisions between vehicles occur.
