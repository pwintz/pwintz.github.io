    A method is proposed for analyzing asymptotic stability in the conical approximation of a hybrid system.
    Specifically, this paper introduces the <i>conical transition graph</i> (CTG) to simplify the analysis of asymptotic stability in conical approximations by converting the motion of solutions to a hybrid system into walks through a (discrete) graph.
    By exploiting the fact that pre-asymptotic stability in a conical approximation implies pre-asymptotic stability in the original system, we propose a CTG-based approach to establish asymptotic stability wi	thout constructing a Lyapunov function.
    Examples illustrate the application of CTG-based analysis for proving pre-asymptotic stability.
