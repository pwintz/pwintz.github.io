    Do Not Omit Parentheses For Functions In Text

A common practice for mathematicians is to write certain functions, such as sine and cosine without placing parentheses around the function arguments when the argument consists of a single symbol. 
For example, instead of writing "$\sin(\theta)$", we write "$\sin\theta$".
This practice is often desirable to simplify the notation, but can be confusing when used in the middle of text. 
Instead of writing 
$$
\text{We calculate the value of $\cos h$ to be ...}
$$
include the parentheses:
$$
\text{We calculate the value of $\cos(h)$ to be ...}
$$
