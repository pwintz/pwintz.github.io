When presenting a series of operations performed on an expression, it can be clearer to state the step-by-step recipe of how to perform the manipulations, than to show only the results of each step.
The clearest, of course, would be to provide a step-by-step guide that shows the result from each step. 
Unfortunately, space constraints often prohibit such spacious exposition.

Suppose we want to solve \((a + x)/2 = 3\) for \(x.\)
In the following table, the left shows a purely symbolic approach, which leaves the reader to fill in the gaps. 
The right column describes what is required but does not show the result of every step.  
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Symbolic Manipulation</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$$\begin{aligned}
        &\frac{a + x}{2} = 3 \\ 
        &a + x = 6  \\ 
        &x = 6 - a
        \end{aligned}$$ 
    </td>
    <td>
        Multiply both sides by \(2,\) and subtract \(a\) from both sides. The result is \(x = 6 - a.\)
    </td>
  </tr>
