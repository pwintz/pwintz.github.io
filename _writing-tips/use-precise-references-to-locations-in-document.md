LaTeX is a powerful tool for cross-referencing. 

Use it. 

Instead of saying, "In a later section...", "In the next section...", or "Below...", say, "In Section 4...".

## Some examples 
- "Results presented in the next section..." "Lemma 3 in Section 4..." 
- "In the above inequality..." "In inequality (4)..."
