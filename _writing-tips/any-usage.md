    Usage of "Any" in Math

One must be careful when using the word “any” in mathematical writing. In certain contexts, “any” is ambiguous. Consider the following: "Suppose equation (1) is satisfied for any $$x>0$$."

What does this statement mean? There are two possibilities: 
1. There exists a value of $x > 0$ such that (1) is satisfied. (“Are there any values of $$x > 0$$ such that (1)?” The answer is "yes" if there is at least one such $$x$$).
2. For every $$x > 0$$, equation (1) is satisfied. 

Thus, do not use "any" when what you mean is "all." Use "for all" or "for each" instead.

<!-- There are, however, times when “any” is unambiguous.
Use "any" to denote an arbitrary choice. E.g., "take any $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$. 
In particular, when combined negation, "not any" clearly means that there are none. . Use "not any" to denote non-existance.
