    Usage of "Any" in Math

One must be careful when using the word “any” in mathematical writing because in certain contexts, “any” is ambiguous and can mean both "every" and "at least one". 
Consider the following question: 

> Does $x^2 = 0$ hold for _any_ $x \geq 0$?

There are two correct answers: 
1. We can rewrite the question as, "does there exist _at least one_ $x \geq 0$ such $x^2 = 0$?" The answer is "yes" because $x = 0$ satisfies $x^2 = 0$.
2. Alternatively, we can rewrite the question as, "does _every_ $x \geq 0$ satisfy $x^2 = 0$?" The answer is "no." If $x = 1$, then $1^2 \neq 0$.

Thus, do not use "any" when what you mean is "all." Use "for all" or "for each" instead.

<!-- There are, however, times when “any” is unambiguous.
Use "any" to denote an arbitrary choice. E.g., "take any $x \in \mathbb{R}$. 
In particular, when combined negation, "not any" clearly means that there are none. . Use "not any" to denote non-existance.
