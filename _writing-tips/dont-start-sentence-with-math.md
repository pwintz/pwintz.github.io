    Don't Start a Sentence With a Mathematical Expression

Don't start a sentence with a mathematical expression (numerals, variables, or equations).
Instead, start every sentence with a word. 
Consider, for example, that you have a set $A$. 
It's confusing to say: "$A$ is ..." because the symbol "$A$" looks like the word "A".
Similar confusion can ensue if a sentence ends with a mathematical expression and the next starts with one. 
For example, "The value of $X$ is $2$. $5$, $6$ and $7$ are numbers." It looks, at first blush, that $X = 2.5$.
When a clause ends with a mathematical expression followed by a comma, avoid placing another mathematical expression immediately after the comma. 

There are several ways to avoid starting with a mathematical expression. 
- Say the type of the object before the symbol: "The set $A$ is...," "The expression $\sigma(2 + x)$ represents...", "The inequality $a^2 \leq b^2$ holds for...". 
- Say the name of the object or short description: "The empty set $\emptyset$ is...", "The union $A \cup B$...".
- Reorder the sentence.
