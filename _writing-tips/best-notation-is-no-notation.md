As P.R. Halmos wrote, "the best notation is no notation."
If you can avoid introducing a new symbol, then the text is often more clear and the reader has one less thing to remember.
A rule of thumb is to never use a letter only once. 
Consider the following definition:

> A function $$f$$ is called a _homeomorphism_ if it is continuous and has a continuous inverse.

The symbol $$f$$ serves no purpose since it is not used elsewhere in the definition. Thus, it can be omitted.
