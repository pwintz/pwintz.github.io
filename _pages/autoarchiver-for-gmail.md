The Auto-archiver add-on for Gmail is under review by Gmail. This web page is part of the review process, so it must be published before the app. Hopefully the app will be approved soon. If you would like to get early access to the add-on or be notified when it is released, please email [gmail-autoarchive@googlegroups.com](mailto:gmail-autoarchive@googlegroups.com)

## Description

Anybody who's had email account in school or other large organization has quickly discovered their inbox inundated by emails that range from useless to essential. 
Having too many emails cluttering our inboxes makes it easy to miss important messages. 
A partial solution to this is to set up email filters that automatically ignore irrelevant emails and prioritize emails from important senders. 
This works fine for emails that clearly fall into one category or the other, but many messages are somewhere in between. 
Many emails are briefly relevant but quickly become unimportant, such as the announcement of an upcoming event. 
Before the event, you may want to see the announcement, but afterward it is only clutter in your inbox. 

To address this problem, I developed the *Gmail Auto-archiver* add-on. This add-on allows you to automate the cleanup of your inbox by nightly archiving each email that are labeled as "autoarchive/X" (for X = 1, 2, 3, etc.) if that email was received more than X days ago.

[Once the add-on is published, a link will be included here.]
