I, Paul Wintz, am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Under the advisement of Professor Ricardo Sanfelice, I study various topics within the domain of hybrid systems. My research interests include 
- Switching schemes between multiple controllers for achieving asymptotic stability
- Approximation theory for hybrid systems
- Model predictive control
- Numerical simulation of hybrid systems

Outside of research, I have wide ranging interests including music, art, comedy/improv, and books. You can see links to my presence across the internet at my [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/paulwintz).
