<!-- 
On my local machine, this file contains my phone number for inclusion in my CV. 
However, I prefer to keep my number secret, so I do not commit it, but if does not exist than my CV breaks. 
Here is my solution:
1. Add and commit this file to Git without my number.
2. Edit the file to contain my number.
3. Tell Git to ignore the change using `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged my_phone_number.html`
