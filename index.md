<!-- # About -->

I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Under the advisement of Professor Ricardo G. Sanfelice, I study various topics within the domain of hybrid systems. My research interests include 
- Switching schemes between multiple controllers for achieving asymptotic stability
- Approximation theory for hybrid systems
- Model predictive control
- Numerical simulation of hybrid systems

Outside of research, I have wide-ranging interests including music, art, improv, and books. You can find links to my presence across the internet at my [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/paulwintz).
