# ARTICLE 3 APPOINTMENT SECURITY 

ASEs' appointment will be specified in the Written Notice of Appointment.
A. If an individual receives and accepts appointments to (an) ASE position(s) for one or more term (i.e., quarter or semester) in an academic year, and the position offered and accepted is no longer available, the University will ensure that the individual:

1. is placed in an appointment at the classification and equivalent compensation level offered and accepted; or
2. receives equivalent compensation in lieu of the position for the term at the level offered.
B. Failure to accept an offer in its entirety, and subject to all conditions, nullifies the offer in its entirety. However, after accepting an offer a Teaching Assistant, Acting Instructor-Graduate Student, Special Reader, Teaching Fellow or Associate In may turn down one or more terms of employment without forfeiting the provisions in this article for the following reasons: the employee's serious health condition as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), to accept an extramural fellowship, or another reason granted by the University.
C. An individual who has accepted (an) ASE position(s) for one or more terms who becomes academically ineligible may be removed without pay from or returned to said appointment as set forth below.
3. Within the first five (5) weeks of an academic term, the University may, at its sole discretion, remove an ASE who has become academically ineligible.
4. When an ASE has regained academic eligibility, the University will determine in its sole discretion whether or not to reinstate the ASE. Said reinstatement, if any, will be at the level of employment held prior to removal.
