1. a Partial Fee Remission of $100 \%$ of Tuition and the Student Services Fee;
2. a Partial Fee Remission covering $100 \%$ of campus fees, not to exceed the maximum campus fees for each campus. This provision shall be effective for academic year 2023-2024,

## C. FEE EQUIVALENCY FOR ASEs ENROLLED IN SELF SUPPORTING PROGRAMS

An ASE who is a registered graduate student with (an) ASE appointment(s) totaling $25 \%$ or more, who is enrolled in a self-supporting graduate degree program and is employed by either a UC self-supporting program or a UC state-supported graduate program, shall be eligible to receive a partial fee remission equivalent in dollar amount to what an eligible ASE enrolled in a UC state-supported program would receive for tuition and student services fee, as a result of the qualifying appointment. In no case will that remission exceed the total charges paid by the ASE to the self-supporting program. Self-supporting graduate degree programs that are subject to this provision are only those programs which have an approved self-supporting fee or charge approved in writing by the UC President.

## D. CURRENT PRACTICE FOR NRST

Pursuant to University policy, the annual NRST charge for graduate doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy is reduced by 100%. A graduate doctoral student may receive the reduced NRST rate for a maximum of three (3) years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiving the reduced charge for three years will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at the time.
