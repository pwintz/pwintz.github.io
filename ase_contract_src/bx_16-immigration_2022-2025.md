The University will request that a federal immigration agent or a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent comply with legal requirements before they may be allowed to interrogate, search or seize the person or property of any ASE while the ASE is working on the University's premises and under the University's control. In the event that the University is served with a validly executed Search or Arrest warrant, the University shall arrange for a questioning of ASEs to occur in as private a setting as possible in the workplace. The University will notice the union if the University learns of an immigration investigation regarding an ASE.

The University may require proof of the appointment and/or hearings and proof of the family relationship.
E. In the event that an ASE is not authorized to work in the United States of America and the ASE's employment is terminated for this reason, the University agrees to meet with the Union and the ASE to make reasonable efforts to reemploy the ASE for the following academic term. If re-employed, the ASE would have to provide valid work authorization.
F. Should any change in laws or regulations relevant to these procedures, including but not limited to repeal of DACA, rescinding of TPS, travel bans, or any other change in immigration law or regulations, or a court ruling that sets forth any new interpretation pertaining to these procedures occur, then, at the union's request, the parties shall meet, in accordance with section $G$ below, to determine whether any adjustments to these procedures are necessary to comply with the new legal requirements. The University may need to comply with the law irrespective of its obligation to meet with the union.
G. Joint Labor Management Committee - the University and the UAW shall use the labor management meeting process in accordance with Article 17 - Labor Management Meetings to discuss issues arising from this article.
