## D. NON-EXCLUSIVITY

The above enumeration of management and academic rights is not exhaustive and does not exclude other management and academic rights not specified herein, nor shall the exercise or non-exercise of rights constitute a waiver of any such rights by the University.

## E. GRIEVANCE/ARBITRATION

No action taken by the University with respect to a management or academic right shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure or collateral suit, unless the exercise thereof violates an express written provision of this agreement.
