1. For the purposes of this Article only,
a. Service in the uniformed services includes service in the uniformed services as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), as well as state military and naval service.
b. "Pregnancy" includes pregnancy, childbirth, and medical conditions related to pregnancy, and childbirth.
c. "Gender expression" means a person's gender-related appearance or behavior, or the perception of such appearance or behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with the person's sex assigned at birth.

The Acknowledgement and Waiver Form will reflect that the ASE has elected to pursue arbitration as the exclusive dispute mechanism for such claim and that the ASE understands the procedural and substantive differences between arbitration and the other remedial forum or forums in which the dispute might have been resolved, including the differences in the scope of remedies available in arbitration as compared to other forums. The timeline to appeal to Arbitration set forth in Article 12, Grievance and Arbitration, will be extended by 30 days for said grievances to enable the ASE to make an informed choice.

## B. SEXUAL HARASSMENT

1. The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in an atmosphere free of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation.

The University shall respond promptly and effectively to reports of prohibited behavior and shall take appropriate action to prevent, to correct, and when necessary, to discipline behavior that violates the law, this Article, and SVSH Policy.

a. Quid Pro Quo: A person's submission to or rejection of unwelcome sexual conduct is implicitly or explicitly made the basis for employment decisions, academic evaluation, or advancement, or other decisions affecting participation in a University program or activity; or
b. Hostile Environment: Unwelcome sexual or other sex-based conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it unreasonably denies, adversely limits, or interferes with a person's participation in or benefit from the education, employment or other programs and services of the University and creates an environment that a reasonable person would find to be intimidating or offensive.
3. Sexual conduct includes sexual or romantic advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
4. Sexual harassment may include incidents between any members of the University community, including: administrators, faculty and other academic appointees (including ASEs), staff, student employees, students, coaches, residents, interns, and non-student or non-employee participants in University programs (e.g., vendors, contractors, visitors, and patients); in hierarchical relationships and between peers, and; between individuals of any gender or gender identity.
