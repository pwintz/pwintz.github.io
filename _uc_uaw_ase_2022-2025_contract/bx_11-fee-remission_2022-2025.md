For those <span class="tooltip">ASEs<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Academic Student Employee</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "Academic Student Employee" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> eligible for a <span class="tooltip">Partial Fee Remission<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Partial Fee Remission</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "Partial Fee Remission" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span>, the University will provide:

In no case will that remission exceed the total charges paid by the ASE to the self-supporting program. Self-supporting graduate degree programs that are subject to this provision are only those programs which have an approved self-supporting fee or charge approved in writing by the UC President.

## D. CURRENT PRACTICE FOR NRST

Pursuant to University policy, the annual <span class="tooltip">NRST<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Nonresident Supplemental Tuition</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "Nonresident Supplemental Tuition" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> charge for graduate doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy is reduced by 100%. A graduate doctoral student may receive the reduced NRST rate for a maximum of three (3) years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiving the reduced charge for three years will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at the time.
