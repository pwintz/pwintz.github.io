Statewide Membership Meeting,SMM,"I believe that the UAW 8411 by-laws mandate one SMM per year, and they may be called at-need otherwise.

It is similar to a JC meeting, but all members who attend are entitled to a vote, and it’s decisions are “stronger” than JC decisions just like JC decisions are stronger than EB: any decision of the smaller body may (theoretically) be overruled by the larger.

In practice, an email will go out to all members about the meeting time and place. They are often long, and quite formal with regards to Robert’s Rules etc. They often include particularly important decisions
