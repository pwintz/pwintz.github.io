# Formatting of Definitions, Remarks, and Theorems
1. Using italics for definitions and remarks. Only the text of Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, and Corollaries should be italicized.
2. When defining a term, use italics. This can also save space because you can omit “is defined as”
3. Not using `\operatorname` to typeset math operators.
