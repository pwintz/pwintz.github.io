# Choose Mathematics Symbols/Notation

When choosing symbols for mathematical objects (variables, sets, etc.), it is a good idea to choose symbols that are 

- Descriptive
- Consistent with conventions
- Easily distinguished from other notation in use.

This document contains guidelines to aid in quickly picking a good symbol.

### Starting Sounds

When choosing a symbol, it is helpful to choose it such that there is a connection between the symbol and its meaning. The most basic approach is to use the Latin character that starts a word related to the symbol’s meaning, such as $$g$$ or $$G$$ for gravity. After exhausting the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet can be used. (The name of each Greek letter generally starts with the sound it makes in a Greek word. For instance, gamma ($$\gamma$$ and $$\Gamma$$) makes a “g” sound, so it would be a reasonable choice for a gravity symbol if $$g$$  and $$G$$  are already used elsewhere.) 

| First letter/Sound | Symbols |
| --- | --- |
| ‘a’ as in “ape” or “apple” | $$a, A, \alpha$$, $$\aleph$$ |
| ‘b’ | $$b,\beta, B$$ |
| ‘d’ (’distance’) | $$d, D, \delta, \Delta$$ |
| ‘e’ as in “eat” or “egg” | $$e, E, \eta$$ |
| ‘f’, 'ph’ as in “first” | $$\phi,\varphi,  \Phi, f, F$$ |
| ‘g’ (‘good’) | $$g, G, \gamma, \Gamma$$ |
| ‘j’ (’James’, ‘gee’) | $$j, J$$, $$g$$, $$G$$ |
| ‘k’ (’king’, ‘compact’) | $$k, K, \chi, X, c, C$$ |
| ‘l’ (’lemma’, “Lie”) | $$l, L, \ell, \lambda, \Lambda$$ (The symbol $$\ell$$ \ell is generally preferable to $$l$$ l, as it’s less likely to mistaken for a $$1$$ 1 and vice versa.) |
| ‘m’ | $$m, M, \mu$$ |
| ‘n’ | $$n, N, \nu$$ |
| ‘o’ | $$o, O, \omega, \Omega$$ |
| ‘p’ | $$p, P, \pi, \Pi$$ |
| ‘r’ (’radius’) | $$r, R, \rho$$ |
| ‘s’ (’see’, ‘psychic’, ‘cease’) | $$s, S, \psi, \Psi, \sigma, \varsigma,  \Sigma, c, C, \xi, \Xi$$  |
| ‘t’ (’tensor’, ‘trig’) | $$t, \tau, T$$ |
| ‘th’ | $$\theta, \Theta$$, $$t, T$$, $$\mathrm{Th}, \mathrm{th}$$, $$\vartheta$$ (\vartheta) |
| ‘u’ (’you’, ‘young’) | $$u, U$$ (Lowercase upsilon $$\upsilon$$ should be avoided due to the similarity to lowercase vee $$v$$) |
| ‘v’ | $$v, V$$ |
| ‘w’ | $$w, W$$ |
| z | $$z, Z$$ |

### Creating a new symbol that is related to an existing symbol.

Suppose we are using the symbol $$x$$ and want to introduce a second symbol that is strongly related to $$x.$$  The following modifications can be used to create a new symbol.

| $$x^1, x^{(2)}, x^a, x^*, x^\circ$$ | Superscript. Numbers should be avoided when they could be confused with exponents. |
| --- | --- |
| $$x_1, x_a, ...$$ | Subscripts. Having more than two layers of subscripts should be avoided to preserve readability. |
| $$x', x'', x'''$$ | Prime notation. Commonly used for derivatives, so avoid when there may be confusion. Use at most three tick marks. |
| $$x_{I}, x_{II}, x_{III}, x_{IV}$$ | Annotate with Roman Numerals. I’ve never seen this notation in a publication, but I use it within my scratch work to keep track of different iterations while I develop my work. If, say, I’m trying to find a set that satisfies some properties, I might notation them $$A_I, A_{II}, ...$$, until I find one that works. Then, I would simply call the final choice $$A$$. |
| $$x \mapsto \hat{x}, \tilde{x}, \overline{x}, \underline{x}$$ | Add annotations above or below. |
| $$x \mapsto X$$
$$F \mapsto f$$ | Change capitalization |
| $$x \mapsto \mathrm{x}, \mathbf{x}$$
$$X \mapsto \mathcal{X}, \mathbb{X}, \mathbf{X}, \mathscr{X} , \mathfrak{X}$$  | Change the font. This should be used with caution because the difference between certain fonts will not be obvious to all readers, especially in handwritten text. |
| $$x_{\textrm{label}}$$, $$x^{\textrm{label}}$$ | Include text labels. This is a heavy-handed approach that is tedious to write, but it does not require remembering another piece of notation so it might be desirable in presentations where the audience cannot go back to review the notation. Avoid for symbols that occur often. |
| $$a \mapsto b, \text{or } x\mapsto y$$ | Use letters that are adjacent in the alphabet. |
| $$x \mapsto p_x, A_x$$ | Juxtaposition with another symbol. Use $$x$$ as a label for another symbol |
| $$V \mapsto \Lambda$$ | https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/18157/rotating-a-letter (doesn’t work for $$x$$ due to its symmetry). |
| $$x \mapsto \Delta x, dx, \delta x$$ | Prefix with another symbol (typically, $$\Delta x$$ represents a change in $$x$$; $$\delta x$$ represents a small but finite change in $$x$$, and $$dx$$ is used to represent the change in $$x $$ in the limit as the change goes to zero.) |
| $$x \mapsto [x]$$, $$\{x\}$$, $$\|x\|$$ | Brackets. Most brackets have existing meanings. |
| $$x \mapsto f(x)$$ | Function notation.  |
| $$1 + x^2$$ | Sometimes, a new symbol is not actually necessary. For instance, if the new symbol depends on $$x,$$ you can simply write it as a function of $$x$$. |

### Object Types

| Type of Object | Common Notation Classes |
| --- | --- |
| Set | Capital Latin or Greek ($$A, B, C, \Lambda$$), Calligraph ($$\mathcal{A, B, C}$$), Blackboard bold (typically reserved for well-known sets: $$\mathbb{R, N, Z}$$), Script (commonly used for sets of sets—$$\mathscr{A, B, C}$$), explicit: $$\{a, b, c\}$$ |
| Vector | $$x, \mathbf{x}, \vec{x}, \underline{x}$$. In texts where students are newly acquainted to vectors, $$\mathbf{x}$$ or $$\vec x$$ is commonly used. The notation $$\vec x$$ has the advantage that it can easily be written by hand, but it makes equations more cluttered, especially when other annotations are added, such as $$\dot{\vec{\widetilde{x}}}$$. In advanced texts, $$x $$ is almost always used. |
|  Vector field | See "Function" |
| Scalar | $$a, b, c, x, y, z, \alpha, \beta, \gamma$$ |
| Unitary Operation | Prefix: $$x\mapsto -x$$, $$f \mapsto \partial f$$; <br> annotations: $$f\mapsto \hat f, f\mapsto \tilde f, x\mapsto x^*$$;  <br> function notation: $$x\mapsto f(x), f\mapsto \mathcal{L}\{f\}, x\mapsto \sin x$$;  <br> capitalization: $$f \mapsto F$$,  <br> sub/superscripts: $$x \mapsto x_{\text{new}}$$ |
| Binary Operation | infix: $$a+b, A\cup B$$, <br> function: $$f(x, y)$$, <br> juxtaposition: $$xy, \overset{x}{y}, \underset{x}{y}, x^y$$, <br> brackets: $$(x, y), \langle x, y\rangle$$ |
| n-ary Operation | Prefix: $$\Pi_{i=1}^n x_i$$  <br>(Abbreviated) Sequence: $$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n$$ <br>Function: $$f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$$ <br>Einstein Summation Convention: $$v_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$$ |
| Matrix | Capital Latin or Greek: $$A, B, C, \Gamma;$$ <br>Upright Capital Latin: $$\mathrm{A, B, C, M}$$; <br>Bold Capital Latin: $$\mathbf{A, B, C, M}$$ |
| Function | lowercase Latin: $$d, f, g, h, u, v, w, x, y, z$$, <br> lowercase Greek: $$\alpha, \beta, \gamma, ...$$; <br> capital Latin: $$F, G, H, ...$$; <br> and capital Greek: $$\Gamma, \Theta, \Phi, \Psi, \Omega, \Xi$$. <br> Often the choice of symbol for a function matches the convention used for objects in the function’s codomain (range). |

### Real Numbers

Typically, lowercase Latin or Greek letters are used to represent real numbers. Less commonly, uppercase letters are used as well.

Several characters, namely $$\pi$$ and $$e$$, have well-established usage, so they should be avoided when there is any risk of ambiguity. The letters $$\varepsilon$$ and $$\delta$$ are frequently used to represent small positive numbers and capital letters such as $$M$$ or $$R$$ are sometimes used for large values. 

For Latin letters, note that $$e$$ has a well-established usage as Euler’s constant. Be judicious in the us of $$f, g, h$$ (used for functions).

Avoid $$i, j, k, m, n$$  (reserved for integers), and  $$l, o$$ (due to protentional confusion with $$1$$  and $$0$$—the symbol $$\ell$$ can be used instead of $$l$$). 

### Integers (and Natural Numbers)

Typically, lowercase and (less frequently) uppercase Latin letters are used to represent integers. The letters $$i, j, k, m, n$$  are common choices and are rarely used for real numbers so that can be useful for guiding the reader in settings where there is a mixture of real numbers and integers. Note that $$i$$ or $$j$$ is used for the imaginary unit $$\sqrt{-1}$$ in some context. The letters $$a, b, c, d, p, q$$ are also commonly used for integers but are also used as real numbers. Avoid $$l, o$$ (due to protentional confusion with $$1$$  and $$0$$—$$\ell$$ can be used instead of $$l$$). Capital letter is useful to convey that an integer will be “large”. 

## Variables vs. Constants

Some authors[who?] prefer the beginning of the alphabet for constants and the end for variables (I don’t know where I saw this but I find it useful). So $$a, b, c, d, p, q, r$$ are preferred for constants and $$t, u, v, w, x, y, z$$ are preferred for variables.

## Note on Fraktur letters

The Fraktur letters, which are typeset using `\mathfrak{}` provide an expanded arsenal of symbols that are sufficiently distinct from standard or calligraph letters to be used in the same document. For example, $$L, \mathcal{L}$$, and $$\mathfrak{L}$$ will likely be recognized as distinct symbols. However, many of the Fraktur characters are easily confused with each other so care should be used to avoid mixing, say $$\mathfrak{I}$$ and $$\mathfrak{J}$$ in the same document.
