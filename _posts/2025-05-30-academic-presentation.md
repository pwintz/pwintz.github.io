# Content Design

## Visual Design of Slides

- Have slide numbers.
- Limit the amount of content on each slide.
- Make text large enough to be read in the setting. This requires knowledge of the room you are presenting in and the size of the screen.
- Make the aspect ratio of your slides match the screen.
- Make a handout version available.
- If including a QR code on a slide, make it as large as possible that it can be scanned easily.
- Slides should have a clear visual flow to their content, either form top to bottom or left t

# Speaking


Speak loudly and clearly. 
If your audience cannot understand you, then they will immediately get bored, nobody will learn anything, and everybody's time is wasted.
If you are not an experienced speaker, it is difficult to judge how audible you actually are. 
Many inexperienced or shy speakers overestimate how loud their voice is at the back of the room. 
The best way to ensure that you are loud enough is to do a test in the space with the audio equipment that you will use for the actual presentation. 
Have a friend or colleague stand at the back of the room while you give the beginning of the talk and adjust your volume until they confirm it is good.
Be prepared to compensate in the moment if the room becomes noisier. 

Aside from being too quiet, your speaking voice can difficult to understand if you have a strong accent or speech impediment, or speak too fast.
I know from experience that speech impediments can (in some cases) be reduced through practice, speech exercises, and constructive feedback. 
<!-- For me, a singing class was  -->
While I don't have experience with accents, I assume that practice and feedback is also a reliable why to improve the clarity of speech.
In the case of a presentation, you can largely script our what you will say beforehand, which allows you to practice the specific words you expect to say _and_ selectively adjust your choice of words to avoid words that are difficult.

Once you have established a sufficiently loud and clear speaking voice, make your talk more captivating by modulating your pitch and volume. 
A loud monotone is better than an inaudible monotone, but audible and dynamic speech is best!

# Online or Hybrid Presentations

Giving presentations that are broadcast via Zoom or other video sharing tools come with extra difficulties. 
When giving a presentation online, you should ensure the following:

- your speech is audible and clear.
- pointing at slides is visible online (e.g., use cursor)
- audio from video can be heard. 
- disruptions (intentional or otherwise) from the audience are prevented
- If using a dual-monitor setup (e.g., laptop screen+projector), make sure you have the right content displayed online.
- disable notifications 

## Zoom settings
There are several Zoom-specific settings that should be set for presentations. 
- Password protect the meeting to stop Zoom bombers.
- Have a dedicated Zoom admin to monitor the meeting and respond to disruptions. They should know how to stop audience interaction, kick members, mute members. A good monitor would be in the room but have the Zoom meeting open so they can watch the chat and check that the presentation is visible.
