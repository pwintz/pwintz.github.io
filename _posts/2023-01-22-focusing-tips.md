Grad school is hard. Don't get me wrong, there are breakthroughs, epiphanies, and moments of success that make it rewarding and worthwhile, but getting to those points requires sloughing through work that is often frustrating or tedious. It takes more than willpower to stay on task for 5+ years in a world where the internet is always at our fingertips. To succeed you must shape your environment into one that helps you focus.

# Software Tools

## Social Media
- Uninstall social media apps from your phone. 
  If you choose to access social media on your phone, then use the browser to access the mobile website. 
  Typically, the mobile website has a worse interface, which degrades the experience, making it less enjoyable. 
- Log out of each social media account when you exit so that you must go through the login process each time, thereby adding friction. 
  To further increase friction: 
    - Use a long but memorable password. Do not save it in a password manager so that you must type it out each time you log in.
    - Enable multifactor authentication and do not "save browser," so that you must receive a code to log in.
- Disable "endless scrolling" (if possible) so that feeds are separated into pages, which give you "exit points" 
- Unfollow or mute all or most of the people in your social media feeds. To completely hide social media feeds on computer browsers, use an extension like "News Feed Eradicator" for [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg](Chrome) or [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/news-feed-eradicator/](Firefox).  
- Use phone apps or browser extensions to restrict access.
