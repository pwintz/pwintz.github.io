## Designing Graphics

Creating graphics can be broken down into three steps:

1. **Generating the content.** For a plot, this would consist of collecting measurements and doing data processing. 
<!-- For geometry, it might  -->
2. **Designing the graphic.** What type of plot will you use? How is it laid out? What is included? Selecting the type of graphic (scatter plot, 2D vs. 3D, histograms, etc.) Are there any elements that you should highlight? What colors will you use? 
3. **Rendering the image.** Turn a hand-drawn sketch into a publication worthy image. 

These three steps are not necessarily executed sequentially in this order. Some times you may have an idea for the graphic, which you sketch and then need to backtrack to collect or parse the necessary data. 
Similarly, it is often the case that you uncover a problem with your design (or data!) while rendering, or simply realize that a different type of plot would show the data better, sending you back to step 2 (or 2!). 

For this post, I won't delve into how to generate content, since that is diverse topic that depends on your specific topic of research.
I will note several types of content that are commonly encountered:

1. Data 
2. Trajectories of dynamical systems
4. Schematics and Diagrams
  * Feedback diagrams
  * Circuits diagrams
  * Flow charts
5. Geometric shapes and relations
6. (Mathematical) functions
7. Photographs
8. Maps
0. Illustrations
 



## Drawing Graphics (The Processâ„¢)

Making nice graphics and animations can take a very long time, especially if you try to make every image look perfect. 
Since this is something I struggle with, I use the following process when making graphics:

1. **Short Sketches.** Set a timer for 2 to 5 minutes (depending on complexity). 
While the timer is running, make a sketch of how the graphic should look. The sketch should be drawn by hand on paper or a tablet. 
It shouldn't be pretty or contain all of the details, but it should show the overall layout. 
For a 3D plot, you would pick the orientation of the axes and figure out how to arrange things that avoids obscuring important components. 
Repeat as needed, until you have a sketch that seems like it will work well.
2. **Long sketch.** Set a timer for 20 minutes. Draw (still by hand) a more careful layout of the graphic. Don't make it perfect, but make the layout as nice as you can make in the time available.
3. **Rendering.**

## Graphics 

My go-to graphics apps are:

- Inkscape for most drawings, especially geometric things
- Draw.io for flowcharts or other diagrams with arrows connecting things
- TikZ for when I think it's going to be simple/when I hate myself, or to overlay content onto figures
- ImageMagick for batch editing photos via command line
- Gimp for editing photos
- Blender for 3D modeling
<!-- - Matlab for when I'm plotting data (Python is definitely better but  I'm too far entrenched now ðŸ˜­), -->


## Animations

## Creating Animations in Inkscape
For many animations, I make them in Inkscape by creating layers that either overlay or replace each other.
