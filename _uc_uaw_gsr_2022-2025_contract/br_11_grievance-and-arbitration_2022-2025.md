Such hearing shall take place after the arbitrator's decision on arbitrability and at least four weeks before the arbitrator's cancellation deadline.</div>

<div class="lvl2"><b>8.</b> Within sixty (60) calendar days from selection, the parties shall attempt to agree to a hearing date, but if they are unable to agree, the authority for scheduling a hearing date shall reside with the arbitrator.</div>

## L. BIFURCATION

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> The University shall be precluded from raising arbitrability claims if it has not done so by the Step 3 response, unless such issues arise after the Step 3 response is issued. Arbitrability claims must include facts and arguments to substantiate such claims.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> The arbitration process shall be bifurcated where the University and Union do not resolve properly made arbitrability claims at the pre-arbitration conference.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>3.</b> Any party requesting a hearing on the issue of arbitrability must do so within seven (7) business days of selecting an arbitrator. If such a request is not made within seven (7) business days of choosing an arbitrator, the issue of arbitrability shall be resolved by briefs, not hearing.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> Written Briefs</div>

The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be resolved in a written decision based on arguments submitted by the parties prior to and separate from the hearing (if any) on the merits of the claim. Such arguments shall be submitted to the arbitrator in brief form according to the following schedule:
<div class="lvl3"><b>a.</b> 
 The University shall submit its brief no later than thirty (30) calendar days from selection of an arbitrator at the pre-arbitration conference.</div>
<div class="lvl3"><b>b.</b> 
 The Union shall submit its response brief no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the University's brief.</div>
<div class="lvl3"><b>c.</b> 
 The arbitrator shall issue their response no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the Union's brief.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>5.</b> If the University fails to meet the timeline, it is precluded from making arbitrability claims, and the grievance shall proceed to a hearing on the merits.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>6.</b> If the Union fails to submit a response brief, the arbitrator shall issue a ruling based on the record from the University's brief.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>7.</b> Hearing on Arbitrability</div>

Where a party timely requests a hearing on arbitrability, such hearing shall be held. If a hearing on arbitrability has been timely requested, the moving party shall contact the arbitrator within five (5) calendar days of making such a request to request two (2) dates (or sets of dates) for a separate hearing on arbitrability and a hearing on the merits which shall take place after the arbitrator's decision on arbitrability and at least four weeks before the arbitrator's cancellation deadline. If the moving party does not request two (2) dates (or sets of dates) for separate hearings within five (5) days of requesting a hearing on arbitrability, the issue of arbitrability shall be resolved by briefs, instead of a hearing.
<div class="lvl2"><b>8.</b> If the arbitrator finds the grievance to be not arbitrable, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.</div>

## M. MEDIATION (optional step)

The parties may mutually agree to engage in grievance mediation and request a state mediator or choose a different arbitrator from the panel to serve as a mediator in order to resolve cases prior to a hearing. Mediation shall occur at least four (4) weeks before the arbitrator's cancellation deadline, unless another timeline is mutually agreed to. However, if the parties agree to engage in grievance mediation, nothing in this paragraph shall supplant the grievance process timelines from continuing, unless mutually agreed by the parties. If a settlement is reached in grievance mediation, the settlement shall be in writing and signed by the parties. Such agreement shall not be precedent-setting.

<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> If the grievance is sustained in whole or in part, the remedy shall not exceed restoring to the grievant the pay, benefits or contractual rights lost less any compensation from any source including but not limited to Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Compensation or other employment.
