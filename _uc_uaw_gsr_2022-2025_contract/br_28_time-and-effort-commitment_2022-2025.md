<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> For Trainees and Fellows, the language in this Article is not intended to supersede the language of the applicable grant or fellowship, which may require different levels of effort.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>B.</b> DISPUTES</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>5.</b> Bargaining unit members are encouraged to informally resolve any concerns about the hours worked with their Supervisor or Department Chair.

## C. GRADUATE STUDENT ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES

This Agreement should not in any way be construed as imposing a limit on the amount of academic effort necessary for a graduate student to make satisfactory academic progress toward their degree. Workload assigned to bargaining unit members may be separate from the academic requirements associated with thesis/dissertation research, and/or academic progress required by their program that they must fulfill as graduate students.
