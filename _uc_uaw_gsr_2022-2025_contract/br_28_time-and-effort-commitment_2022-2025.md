# ARTICLE 28 <br> TIME AND EFFORT COMMITMENT 

## A. GENERAL CONDITIONS

1. The GSR's workload will be commensurate with the appointment percentage and title/classification.
2. The GSR's required workload must be reasonable and related to the program's research needs, with the emphasis placed on meeting the responsibilities assigned to the position, on making progress toward their research goals, and on demonstrating their intellectual capabilities. It is understood that the workload may fluctuate in a given time period (e.g. workweek, month, academic term) due to the general functions and activities within a research lab or program.
3. Any work assignment, including required training, orientation, required meetings, required conferences, shall be included in the total workload for the appointment period.
4. For Trainees and Fellows, the language in this Article is not intended to supersede the language of the applicable grant or fellowship, which may require different levels of effort.
B. DISPUTES
5. Bargaining unit members are encouraged to informally resolve any concerns about the hours worked with their Supervisor or Department Chair. In the event the concerns are not resolved informally, the GSR may file a formal grievance at step one.
6. If not resolved by the conclusion of the step two process, the GSR may file directly to arbitration.

## C. GRADUATE STUDENT ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES

This Agreement should not in any way be construed as imposing a limit on the amount of academic effort necessary for a graduate student to make satisfactory academic progress toward their degree. Workload assigned to bargaining unit members may be separate from the academic requirements associated with thesis/dissertation research, and/or academic progress required by their program that they must fulfill as graduate students.
