# ARTICLE 26 

## RESPECTFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT

## A. GENERAL CONDITIONS

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> The University and UAW are jointly committed to promoting and maintaining a work environment that is healthy and free of Abusive Conduct, in which every employee and member of the University community is treated with respect.</div>
2 The Parties mutually acknowledge that Abusive Conduct creates an intimidating environment and may interfere with an employee's work. These behaviors may occur in, but are not limited to, situations in which one person has authority over another and situations involving peer-topeer interactions.
3 The University and UAW shall strive to foster an environment in which employees feel comfortable making reports of Abusive Conduct in good faith. The Parties also commit to prohibiting retaliation against any person who reports Abusive Conduct or participates in any related investigation or other process in good faith.

## B. DEFINITIONS

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> Abusive Conduct is harassing or threatening behavior that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct in the workplace that denies, adversely limits, or interferes with an employee's participation in or benefit from University employment. The Conduct creates an environment, whether intended or not, that is objectively intimidating or offensive and unrelated to the University's legitimate educational, employment, and business interests.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> Such conduct shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the parties, relationship between the parties (including power imbalance); the frequency, nature and severity of the alleged conduct; whether the conduct was physically threatening; and whether the conduct may be protected. A single act may constitute Abusive Conduct if especially severe or egregious.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>3.</b> Exercising Academic Freedom (e.g. comments about scholarship, instruction within the classroom, different approaches to curriculum, opposing opinions about policy issues, or academic achievement), as such, is distinct from and does not constitute Abusive Conduct.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> Differences of opinion, miscommunication, differences in work styles, business disagreements handled professionally, interpersonal conflicts, and occasional problems in working relations are an inevitable part of working life and do not necessarily constitute Abusive Conduct.</div>
