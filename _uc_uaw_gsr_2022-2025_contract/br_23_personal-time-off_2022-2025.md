ARTICLE 23
PERSONAL TIME OFF

# A. GENERAL CONDITIONS 

1. Eligibility for pay status during time off is determined by the funding agency. If the funding agency establishes provisions for pay status during time off (including for "Vacation" and "Sick Leave") that are more generous than this article, then this section does not apply.
2. GSRs with an appointment of $25 \%$ or more for a minimum of one full month, are eligible to use personal time off with pay during the length of the appointment. The personal time off shall be up to twelve (12) workdays for a full twelve-month period. For shorter appointments, the twelve (12) workdays will be prorated a day per month for every full month of appointed service.
3. At the commencement of an appointment, the amount of personal time off shall be calculated and communicated to the GSR in the written notice of appointment. Personal time off is available for use on the first day of a GSR's appointment, in accordance with section $B$ below.
4. Personal time off not used during the appointment is not carried over into subsequent appointments. Personal time off not used when the GSR's appointment concludes, including when a GSR leaves the appointment prior to the established appointment end date, expires and may not be carried over.
5. Use of personal time off is recorded in one-day increments. Approved absences of less than a day do not require the use of personal time off. For the purposes of this Article, a "day" means the GSR's regular workday. GSRs on reduced schedule are charged a full day of personal time off when absent for their entire reduced time "day."

## B. REQUESTING AND USING TIME OFF

1. Use of time off provisions contained in this article requires the advance approval of the University.
a. A GSR shall submit requests for personal time off to their supervisor in accordance with the provisions of section B.2., below. When making such requests, GSRs should attempt to request time off that minimizes the effect on their research.
b. The University may deny requests for personal time off based on operational needs, in accordance with the provisions of section B.2. and 3., below.
c. The University shall not unreasonably deny a GSR's request for personal time off.
2. GSRs are expected to communicate with the supervisor to request personal time off as soon as the need for the time off becomes known. The request must include the information needed by the supervisor to assess the operational impact of the absence.
3. If the supervisor requires that the GSR's request be made in writing, or if the GSR submits the request in writing, the supervisor's response will be made in writing. The supervisor should respond to the request for personal time off as soon as practicable.

## C. CAMPUS CLOSURE

1. During a campus closure that results in a closure of an individual lab/unit, GSRs in that lab/unit shall have the option to use personal time off in order to be paid for the closure days.
2. If GSRs are required to work during a closure, they shall be paid for each day worked and not be required to use personal time off.
