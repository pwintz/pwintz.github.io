The GSR may bring a union representative to the interactive process. This process shall occur as soon as practicable. Options for reasonable accommodation may include but are not limited to: assistive devices; modification of existing facilities; restructuring the job to eliminate non-essential job functions; and leaves of absence. Both the University and the GSR are expected to participate in the interactive process in good faith, which includes engaging in timely communications regarding possible reasonable accommodation.
