<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> A GSR who is eligible to receive a tuition or fee remission through an ASE appointment or through a combination of a GSR and ASE appointment is eligible to receive up to a maximum of one full tuition and fee remission for the given quarter/semester. The amount of the tuition and fee remission may not exceed the amount of tuition and fees charged by the University.</div>

<div class="lvl3"><b>a.</b>

<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> Commencing Academic Year 2023-2024, the University shall provide a Partial Fee Remission to cover 100\% of campus fees, not to exceed the maximum campus fees for each campus.</div>

## C.  FEE EQUIVALENCY FOR GSRs ENROLLED IN SELF-SUPPORTING PROGRAMS

A GSR who is a registered graduate student with a GSR appointment(s) or a combination of a GSR and ASE appointment(s) totaling 25% or more of full-time for an entire given quarter/semester, who is enrolled in a self-supporting graduate degree program and is employed by either a UC self-supporting program or a UC state-supported graduate program, shall be eligible to receive a partial fee remission equivalent in dollar amount to what an eligible GSR enrolled in a UC state-supported program would receive for tuition and student services fee, as a result of the qualifying appointment. In no case will that remission exceed the total charges paid by the GSR to the self-supporting program. Self-supporting graduate degree programs that are subject to this provision are only those programs which have an approved self-supporting fee or charge approved in writing by the UC President.

## D.  CURRENT PRACTICE FOR <span class="tooltip">NRST<span class="tooltip-text">{% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "Nonresident Supplemental Tuition" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span>

Pursuant to University policy, the annual <span class="tooltip">NRST<span class="tooltip-text">{% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "Nonresident Supplemental Tuition" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> charge for graduate doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy is reduced by 100%. A graduate doctoral student may receive the reduced NRST rate for a maximum of three (3) years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiving the reduced charge for three years will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at the time.
