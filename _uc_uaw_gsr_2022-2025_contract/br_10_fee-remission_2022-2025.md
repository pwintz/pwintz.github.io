## D. CURRENT PRACTICE FOR NRST

Pursuant to University policy, the annual NRST charge for graduate doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy is reduced by 100%. A graduate doctoral student may receive the reduced NRST rate for a maximum of three (3) years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiving the reduced charge for three years will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at the time.
