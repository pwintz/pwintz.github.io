# Side Letter <br> UCSF GSR Appointees 

<div class="lvl2"><h2 class="inline-header">A.</h2> This side letter applies to those <span class="tooltip">Graduate Student Researcher<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Graduate student researcher</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "graduate student researcher" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> ("GSR") bargaining unit members at UCSF who meet the following criteria at the time of implementation of the 2022-25 UC-UAW GSR Collective Bargaining Agreement:

- annual employment earnings of \$44,000, derived from a combination of current <span class="tooltip">GSR<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Graduate student researcher</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "graduate student researcher" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> salary point 10 wages and off-scale compensation. "Off-scale compensation" means wages paid to UCSF GSRs that are above the salary associated with their given salary point in the published salary scale that was effective $10 / 1 / 21$.

<div class="lvl2"><h2 class="inline-header">B.</h2> 90 Days from Ratification:

For the <span class="tooltip">GSRs<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Graduate student researcher</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "graduate student researcher" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> described in paragraph A above, UCSF agrees to place them above scale at 50% time at a rate that is equal to 3% higher than their base wages at the time of ratification $(\$ 44,000 \times 1.03=\$ 45,320)$. Following this action, these individuals will no longer receive off-scale compensation.

<div class="lvl2"><h2 class="inline-header">C.</h2> On 10/1/2023:

UCSF will move all <span class="tooltip">GSRs<span class="tooltip-text"><b>Graduate student researcher</b>: {% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "graduate student researcher" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span> described in paragraph A above to point 6 of the new scale $(\$ 47,196)$. This represents an additional 4.1% increase to the ratification rate described in Paragraph 1 above (\$45,320). Accordingly, the wages for these bargaining unit members would be based on the annual range adjustments in the collective bargaining agreement going forward.
