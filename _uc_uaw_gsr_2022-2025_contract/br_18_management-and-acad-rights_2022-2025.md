The above enumerations of management and academic rights are not inclusive and do not exclude other management and academic rights not specified, nor shall the exercise or non-exercise of rights retained by the University be construed to mean that any right is waived.

## D. GRIEVANCE/ARBITRATION

No action taken by the University with respect to a management or academic right shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure or collateral suit unless the exercise thereof violates an express written provision of this Agreement.
