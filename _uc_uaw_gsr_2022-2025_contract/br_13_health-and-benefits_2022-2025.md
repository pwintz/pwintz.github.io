<div class="lvl1"><b>A.</b> Eligible GSRs may participate in a University-sponsored student health insurance plan to the same degree other eligible students at that campus participate. University-sponsored student health insurance plans include the multi-campus UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) administered by the <span class="tooltip">UC Office of the President<span class="tooltip-text">{% assign tooltip_term = site.data.union_glossary | where: "Term", "UC Office of the President" %}{{ tooltip_term[0]["Meaning"] }}</span></span>, and Graduate Student Health Insurance Plans administered by specific campuses who have elected not to participate in UC SHIP.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>B.</b> A GSR who is a registered graduate student with GSR appointment(s) or other eligible academic appointments totaling 25% or more of full-time for a given term in a State-supported or Self-Supporting Program is eligible to receive remission of premium for a University-sponsored student health insurance plan. A GSR is eligible to receive only one premium remission per term. In the event premiums increase, the University will continue to provide 100% premium remissions to eligible GSRs.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>C.</b> The University-sponsored student health insurance plans are student health insurance programs for registered students, and the eligibility for and the availability of these programs are not related to a student's status as a GSR. The parties acknowledge that the terms of the plans, including coverage, carriers, premium rates, or other program provisions, are not a term and condition of employment for a GSR.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>D.</b> A GSR who is eligible to receive a health insurance premium remission through a GSR appointment, or through a combination of GSR and ASE appointments, is also eligible to receive 100% premium remission for their child dependents if the GSR's income exceeds the designated Medi-Cal eligibility threshold.</div>

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> If the GSR has a spouse, and the combination of their income places the GSR's family over the designated Medi-Cal eligibility threshold then the GSR is not eligible for the child dependent premium remission.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> Eligible child dependents are defined by UCSHIP plan regulations.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>E.</b> A GSR who is not a registered student and who is not eligible to participate in a University-sponsored student health insurance plan will be eligible to participate in the non-student University Health Insurance program in the same manner as nonrepresented, non-senate academic employees.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>3.</b> Eligibility to participate in the employee University Health Insurance Program will be in accordance with the University Health Program provisions.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> Costs of the University Health Insurance Program in excess of the University contribution will be borne by the employee and will be paid in accordance with the program provisions.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>5.</b> During the term of this agreement, the University has the sole discretion to alter the terms of the program including but not limited to coverage, carriers, contribution rates or other program provisions.</div>
<div class="lvl1"><b>F.</b> The University and the UAW shall meet twice a year to discuss the University sponsored student health insurance plans. Appropriate topics for discussions are those health insurance related issues that apply to GSRs including systemwide participation in UC SHIP, potential changes in benefits, deductibles, and co-pays.</div>

The University agrees to provide up to 4 hours of paid release time (including travel) to one GSR per campus for the purpose of attending systemwide meetings.
