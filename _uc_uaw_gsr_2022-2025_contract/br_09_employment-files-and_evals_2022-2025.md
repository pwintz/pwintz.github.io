## A.  EMPLOYMENT FILE(S)

"Employment file" shall be defined as information (including reports, documents, correspondence and other materials in their entirety or redacted portions) pertaining to a GSR's employment in the bargaining unit. Materials related to the graduate student's academic progress, including, but not limited to their academic portfolio, studies, courses, and grades shall not be considered part of the employment file.

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> The University shall designate the location where GSRs or their designated representatives may obtain access to the GSR's employment file(s).</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> GSRs will be notified in their Written Notice of Appointment that employment files are established and maintained for GSRs and new material may be added periodically during the term of their employment.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>3.</b> Additionally, a GSR may make a request to their supervisor to add information related to their performance as a GSR to their employment file. Such requests shall be made no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion of the appointment.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>4.</b> A GSR may authorize representatives to review their employment file(s). The authorization shall be valid for the period designated by the individual or, if no time period is designated, for up to one calendar year from the date of authorization. The designee shall have access to all employment information in the file(s).</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>5.</b> The University shall copy the GSR on documents added to the employment files. Documents may include, but are not limited to, Written Notices of Appointment, performance evaluations, disciplinary documents, training compliance, and/or other standard employment file documents.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>6.</b> The University shall provide a GSR or their representatives access to or a copy of the GSR's employment file(s) as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) calendar days, following the University's receipt of a written request. One copy of employment file(s) material shall be free; subsequent copies shall be ten (10) cents per page.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>7.</b> If a GSR disagrees with evaluative material in their file(s), they may append material to the file(s). If an individual is no longer employed when the evaluative material is placed into the file, the GSR has thirty (30) calendar days from the date the GSR reviewed their file(s) or knew or reasonably should have known that it was placed into the file to append material to the file.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>8.</b> If an employment file contains factual non-evaluative information that is incorrect, the GSR may request correction of the file(s) within thirty (30) calendar days of discovery. If a GSR is no longer employed when the factual non-evaluative information is placed into the file, the GSR has thirty (30) calendar days from the date the GSR reviewed their file(s) or knew or reasonably should have known that it was placed into the file to request correction.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>9.</b> Records involving the processing of a grievance, such as grievance/appeals, UC grievance responses, and settlement documents shall not be placed in the GSR's employment file(s).</div>

## B.  EMPLOYMENT EVALUATIONS

<div class="lvl2"><b>1.</b> "Employment evaluation" is the faculty member or supervisor's written assessment(s) of a GSR's employment performance, excluding evaluations of their graduate student status, including, but not limited to academic progress, academic portfolio, studies, courses, and grades.</div>
<div class="lvl2"><b>2.</b> Although employment evaluations are not required, if the employing department or hiring unit is requiring employment evaluations, the department or hiring unit shall communicate evaluation criteria and procedures for written employment evaluations, if any, to employees and the UAW any time upon request.</div>
