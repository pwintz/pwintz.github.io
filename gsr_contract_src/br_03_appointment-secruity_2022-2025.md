# ARTICLE 3 APPOINTMENT SECURITY 

A. GSRs' appointment will be specified in the Written Notice of Appointment.
B. If an individual receives and accepts appointments to a GSR position(s) for one or more terms (i.e., quarter or semester) in a fiscal year, and the position offered and accepted is no longer available, the University will ensure that the individual is placed in an alternate student appointment with substantially similar compensation. Placement is at the University's sole discretion.
C. An individual who has accepted a GSR position(s) for one or more terms who becomes academically ineligible may be removed without pay from or returned to said appointment as set forth below. When an GSR has regained academic eligibility, the University will determine in its sole discretion whether or not to reinstate the GSR. Said reinstatement, if any, will be at the level of employment held prior to removal.
D. The provisions of this Article do not apply to Trainees and Fellows who fail to meet a requirement set by their funding agency, and which causes the funding agency to cancel the Trainee's/Fellow's funding.
