# ARTICLE 10 FEE REMISSION 

## A. ELIGIBILITY

1. A GSR who is a registered graduate student with a GSR appointment(s) or a combination of a GSR and ASE appointment(s) totaling 25% or more of full-time for an entire given quarter/semester is eligible to participate in the University's Partial Fee Remission Program for Tuition and Fees and remission of Nonresident Supplemental Tuition ("NRST") as provided in this Article.
2. A GSR is eligible to receive only one Partial Fee Remission per quarter/semester.
3. Trainees and Fellows shall be eligible for the University's Partial Fee Remission Program for Tuition and Fees and remission of NRST as provided in this Article if the external granting agency requires that the University cover the tuition and fees rather than the external granting agency.
4. A GSR who is eligible to receive a tuition or fee remission through an ASE appointment or through a combination of a GSR and ASE appointment is eligible to receive up to a maximum of one full tuition and fee remission for the given quarter/semester. The amount of the tuition and fee remission may not exceed the amount of tuition and fees charged by the University.

## B. PARTIAL FEE REMISSION

1. For those GSRs eligible for a Partial Fee Remission, the University will provide:
a. A Partial Fee Remission of 100% of Tuition and the Student Services Fee;
b. Partial Fee Remission of $\$100$ per quarter or $\$150$ per semester to partially cover campus fees.
2. Commencing Academic Year 2023-2024, the University shall provide a Partial Fee Remission to cover 100% of campus fees, not to exceed the maximum campus fees for each campus.

## C. FEE EQUIVALENCY FOR GSRs ENROLLED IN SELF-SUPPORTING PROGRAMS

A GSR who is a registered graduate student with a GSR appointment(s) or a combination of a GSR and ASE appointment(s) totaling 25% or more of full-time for an entire given quarter/semester, who is enrolled in a self-supporting graduate degree program and is employed by either a UC self-supporting program or a UC state-supported graduate program, shall be eligible to receive a partial fee remission equivalent in dollar amount to what an eligible GSR enrolled in a UC state-supported program would receive for tuition and student services fee, as a result of the qualifying appointment. In no case will that remission exceed the total charges paid by the GSR to the self-supporting program. Self-supporting graduate degree programs that are subject to this provision are only those programs which have an approved self-supporting fee or charge approved in writing by the UC President.

## D. CURRENT PRACTICE FOR NRST

Pursuant to University policy, the annual NRST charge for graduate doctoral students who have advanced to candidacy is reduced by 100%. A graduate doctoral student may receive the reduced NRST rate for a maximum of three (3) years. Any such student who continues to be enrolled or who re-enrolls after receiving the reduced charge for three years will be charged the full NRST rate that is in effect at the time.
