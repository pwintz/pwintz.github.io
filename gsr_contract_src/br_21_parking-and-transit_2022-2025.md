# ARTICLE 21 <br> PARKING AND TRANSIT 

## A. GENERAL CONDITIONS

1. The University and the UAW agree reducing the carbon footprint is a mutual goal.
2. GSRs shall be eligible to participate in a campus' parking and transit program, if any, in accordance with the provisions of each location's program on the same basis as similarly-situated employees. This includes, but is not limited to, pre-tax/payroll deduction options applicable if the GSR is eligible for such deductions due to their payroll and/or tax status.

## B. ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

1. GSRs are encouraged to participate in alternative transportation programs, if offered, at each location including shuttles, public transportation, bicycle programs, carpool programs and other alternative transportation programs.
2. The University shall move toward enhanced transit programs as follows:
  a. Within 12 months of ratification:
    1) Ensure all locations make pre-tax programs available to eligible employees paid regular wages through UC PATH (excludes Fellows, Trainees) to pay for transit options.
    2) Access to a UC-negotiated e-bike purchase discount program, minimally at fifteen percent (15%), with the goal of twenty percent (20%), below the published retail price for the same bike from the same retailer, subject to appropriate participation in the program. UAW commits to encouraging its bargaining unit members to take advantage of such program through its regular channels of communication.
    3) As a public transit allowance, the University will double match the bargaining unit employee's contribution up to thirty dollars ($30) per month into the pre-tax account referenced in section 1) above according to the following schedule:

            <td>$5</td>
            <td>$10</td>
            <td>$15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$10</td>
            <td>$20</td>
            <td>$30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$15</td>
            <td>$30</td>
            <td>$45</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

    Bargaining unit members at locations which provide access to a no- cost transit pass, as outlined in Section E below (including as part of student fee remission), shall not receive this double matching allowance. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will be included to the extent permitted by the terms of its Department of Energy contract related to cost allowability.
  b. Within 24 months of ratification: Bargaining unit access to enhanced UC Travel measures to reduce the impact of university business travel on carbon emissions, including more accurate carbon impact estimates of travel itineraries and access to discounted electric vehicle rentals.
  c. Within 36 months of ratification: Best efforts by UC to negotiate reduced-fee or no-fee access to the appropriate regional transit system(s) for each location, pursuant to Section E below, where practicable.

## C. NOTICE

The University reserves the sole right to establish and change parking and transit rates, open and close lots and modify parking and transit conditions and regulations. The University shall provide thirty (30) calendar days' advance written notice to the UAW of any proposed change or increase in parking and transit rates. The University shall meet upon request of the UAW to discuss and receive comments regarding any proposed change in parking and transit rates.

## D. LABOR-MANAGEMENT MEETING ON TRANSIT

1. No later than six (6) months after ratification of this Agreement, at the request of the union, the Labor-Management Meeting on Transit ("Meeting") will be convened on a campus basis for the purpose of discussing ways to enhance bargaining unit member access to transit programs to commute to and from the University location.
2. The parties may invite guests, including, but not limited to, subject matter experts, provided there is notice and mutual agreement.
3. The University and UAW shall mutually agree upon an equal number of representatives for each party. The Meeting shall be limited to two (2) hours unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Bargaining unit employees serving on the Labor-Management Meeting on Transit shall be provided release time for time they would have otherwise worked on that day for the purpose of attending the Meeting, provided there is notice in accordance with Article 10 - Labor-Management Meetings.
4. The parties shall propose agenda items for the Meeting no later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the Meeting. If there are no agenda items proposed, the Meeting shall be canceled or rescheduled.
5. While the Labor-Management Meeting on Transit is intended to cover GSRs, nothing shall preclude the parties from agreeing to combine the Meeting with that of other UAW units.
